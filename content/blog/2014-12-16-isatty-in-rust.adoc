summary: How to find a command line program is piped from another program or that program was running directly with arguments?
---

How to find a command line program is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29[piped] from another program or that program was running directly with arguments? For example, `wc` command can be run as both ways.

[source,bash]
----            
# Create a file /tmp/hello.txt                
echo "Hello World" > /tmp/hello.txt
# wc can be used as both ways,
cat /tmp/hello.txt | wc
# or
wc /tmp/hello.txt
----

In Python, it is very easy to identify how a command is run

[source,python]
----
import sys

if sys.stdin.isatty():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    # do something with file, open the file and process it
else:
    # use for `line in sys.stdin` to read line by line
    data = sys.stdin.read()
    # do something with data
----

How to do this in http://rust-lang.org[Rust]?
==================================================
It is very easy in Rust too, see...

[source,rust]
----
use std::io;

fn main(){
    if io::stdio::stdin_raw().isatty(){
        println!("Not pipe");
    }
    else{
        let mut reader = io::stdin();
        loop{
            match reader.read_line() {
                Ok(txt) => println!("Read: {}", txt),
                Err(_e) => break
            }
        }
    }
}
----

To handle all the errors except EOF,

[source,rust]
----
let mut reader = io::stdin();
loop{
    match reader.read_line() {
        Ok(txt) => println!("Read: {}", txt),
        Err(e) => match e.kind{
            io::EndOfFile => break,
            _ => {
                    panic!("ERROR: {}", e);
            }
        }
    }
}
----

We can now create http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29[pipe] aware applications easily in Rust, let me know if you find this useful.

btw, Rust 1.0 is coming, see http://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/12/12/1.0-Timeline.html[here]
