tags: gluster, glusterfsblog
summary: I started working on the Gluster dashboard using Phoenix Liveview feature.

I was introduced to https://www.erlang.org/[Erlang] language by
http://manku.thimma.org/about/[Shashi] in one of the Mysore Linux
user group meeting at his office(Feb 2009). That was the time when
NoSql was trending, and http://couchdb.apache.org/[CouchDb] was one
of the popular NoSQL databases. I was very much impressed by the
Erlang programming language and bought the book "Programming Erlang -
Joe Armstrong"

Unfortunately, I couldn't spend much time with the language to develop
any real-time app other than a few Hello World programs.

Finally, I got a chance to work on a
https://elixir-lang.org/[Elixir] project! The trigger is the Phoenix
Live view feature.

I watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJzHq8ru0M[Phoenix Liveview announcement]
15 days ago and immediately impressed by that.

I started working on the https://elixir-lang.org/[Gluster] dashboard using Phoenix
Liveview feature. This dashboard exposes a webhook to receive the
Gluster cluster details. Gluster webhook exporter is written using D
programming language. It runs the required Gluster commands every 10
seconds(configurable) and parses the XML output and pushes the JSON
data to the webhook exposed by the Phoenix application.

**Note**: Running exporter in all nodes is optional, can be run in a
few nodes for better availability. If one node goes down, then
exporter from another node can send the details to the dashboard app.

Phoenix app updates the Cluster state to Db and publishes to all
connected LiveView sockets. All users who opened the dashboard page
will get the updated dashboard.

Gluster dashboard is not yet ready, and I am working on the necessary
features to submit this project for https://phoenixphrenzy.com/[Phoenix Phrenzy] contest.

> Phoenix Phrenzy is a contest for developers to build with Phoenix
> LiveView, show off their software engineering skills, and help
> demonstrate the capabilities of this great technology to the open
> source community.

I am still working on many fixes to this dashboard project, watch this
space for an update on this project. Let me know if the below
screenshots look good. Thanks.
