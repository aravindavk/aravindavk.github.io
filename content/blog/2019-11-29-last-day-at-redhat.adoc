Summary: Last day at Red Hat
Image: /images/last-day-at-redhat.jpg

Today is my last day at Red Hat(Bengaluru, India). It was a fantastic
journey of 7+ years working with Red Hat Storage team and GlusterFS
community.

I will surely be active in the GlusterFS community. Hopefully, we can
meet in the future Gluster meetups.

I think for me exciting things are happening during Nov/Dec :)

- Dec 2005 - Joined Infosys (4 years)

- Nov 2012 - Joined Red Hat (7 years)
- Dec 2019 - Again, starting the new journey.
