Last week I got opportunity to present about Gluster Events APIs in
http://www.meetup.com/glusterfs-India/events/233515975[Gluster meetup Bangalore].

Events APIs will be available with `Gluster 3.9` release.(http://www.gluster.org/pipermail/maintainers/2016-September/001442.html[Release Candidate]
is available if anybody interested in testing)

Without Events APIs, one way to get status of Cluster is by
calling Gluster status command/api in periodic intervals.

Below illustration shows calling `status` once every 10 seconds.

With Events APIs, setup a listener Webhook and register with Gluster
using `gluster-eventsapi webhook-add <URL>`. Call Gluster status
command whenever webhook receives an Event.(Check http://aravindavk.in/blog/10-mins-intro-to-gluster-eventing/[this] blog
to know Webhooks and Events APIs in detail)

As part of presentation, created some visualizations to show how these
real time notifications can be used to refresh the UI automatically
when Gluster cluster state changes.

Following gif shows the UI change immediately after creating a Gluster
Volume.
