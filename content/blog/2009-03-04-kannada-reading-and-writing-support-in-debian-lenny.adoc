Create a folder in your home directory with name ".xinput.d" and create a file "all\_ALL" inside the folder created just now.

        GTK_IM_MODULE=scim-bridge
    else
        GTK_IM_MODULE=xim
    fi
    if [ -e /usr/lib/qt3/plugins/inputmethods/im-scim-bridge.so -o \
         -e /usr/lib/qt4/plugins/inputmethods/im-scim-bridge.so ]

    DEPENDS="scim | skim, scim-bridge-agent, scim-bridge-client-gtk | \
             scim-bridge-client-qt | scim-bridge-client-qt4"


The above xinput script is shared by `Ravi <http://linmaya.net>`__

Save the file and logoff. When you login to your system you will see small keyboard icon in the panel, that means all installations and configurations are successful. 

How to use SCIM
===============

Open gedit or any other text editor, click on the small keyboard icon in panel and select the required keyboard layout. Now we can use Cntrl + Space to toggle Kannada(Previously selected layout) and English. We can even create the folders/files with kannada name  :)

Enjoy!
