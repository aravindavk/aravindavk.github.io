> https://vibed.org[Vibe.d] is an Asynchronous I/O web framework written in https://dlang.org[D programming language].

The usual way to start using Vibe.d web framework is by initializing the project with `dub init -t vibe.d`.  Installing full Vibe.d library with all the sub-packages may not be useful for every project (For example, MongoDB and Redis sub-packages). In the blog post, we will understand how to use only the required sub-packages.

Initialize the new project and add `vibe-http` as the dependency.

[source]
----
$ cd helloweb
$ dub init
Success created empty project in /home/aravinda/sandbox/dlang_try/helloweb
Package successfully created in .
$ dub add vibe-http
Adding dependency vibe-http ~>1.1.0
----

Now import only the required modules and use it.

Example Hello world Vibe.d application:

[source,d]
----
import vibe.core.core;
import vibe.core.log;
import vibe.http.server;

void main()
{
    auto settings = new HTTPServerSettings;
    settings.port = 8080;
    settings.bindAddresses = ["::1", "127.0.0.1"];
    auto listener = listenHTTP(settings, &hello);
    scope (exit)
    {
        listener.stopListening();
    }

    logInfo("Please open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser.");
    runApplication();
}

void hello(HTTPServerRequest req, HTTPServerResponse res)
{
    res.writeBody("Hello, World!");
}
----

Start the web server by running the following commands (or by running `dub build` and then run `./helloweb`).
