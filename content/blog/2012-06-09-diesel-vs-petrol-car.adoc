Since Diesel cars are expensive than Petrol cars, it is very difficult to decide which car is best suited for my usage. I searched in google to find the answer and asked many friends and relatives, but still couldn't decide because of too much information :) 

So started creating a simple online tool to analyze and decide which car is economical based on my planned usage. Click http://aravindavk.github.com/diesel-vs-petrol-car/[here] to use the tool online.
