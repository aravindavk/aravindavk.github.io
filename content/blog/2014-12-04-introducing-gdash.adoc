title: Introducing gdash - GlusterFS Dashboard
tags: glusterfs,tools,glusterfsblog
summary: gdash is a super-young project, which shows GlusterFS volume information about local, remote clusters.
---

**UPDATE:** Added ``--gluster`` option to specify the path to gluster. By default it looks for ``/usr/sbin/gluster``, If you installed GlusterFS using source install then use `sudo gdash --gluster /usr/local/sbin/gluster`. (Those who already installed gdash, can run `sudo pip install -U gdash` to upgrade.)


gdash is a super-young project, which shows GlusterFS volume information about local, remote clusters. This app is based on GlusterFS's capability of executing `gluster volume info` and `gluster volume status` commands for a remote server using ``--remote-host`` option.
 
If you can run `gluster volume info --remote-host=<HOST_NAME>`, then you can monitor that cluster using gdash. Make sure you allow to access glusterd port(24007) for the machine where you will run gdash.

To install,

[source,bash]

    sudo pip install gdash

or

[source,bash]

    sudo easy_install gdash

gdash is created using Python `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`__ and `ember <http://emberjs.com/>`__ (I used `ember-cli <http://ember-cli.com>`__).

Usage
=====
Use case 1 - Local Volumes
--------------------------
Just run `sudo gdash`, gdash starts running in port 8080. visit http://localhost:8080 to view GlusterFS volumes of local machine.

Use case 2 - Remote Volumes
---------------------------
Run `sudo gdash --host 192.168.1.6`, visit http://localhost:8080 to view GlusterFS volume information of remote host. Dashboard shows all the volumes which are part of that remote host.

Use case 3 - Multiple clusters
------------------------------
Create a clusters.conf file as example shown below, specify at least one host from each cluster.

[source,cfg]
----
[clusters]
cluster1 = host1, host2, host3
cluster2 = host4, host5, host6
----

Run `gdash` using, 

[source,bash]
----
sudo gdash --clusters ~/clusters.conf
----

Use case 4 - Multiple teams
---------------------------
If two teams monitoring two clusters and if you don't want to share the other cluster details then, just run below commands in two terminals and give respective URL to each team. Other solution is create two seperate config files and run it separately for different ports.

[source,bash]
----
# Team 1, who monitors cluster1 http://localhost:8001
sudo gdash -p 8001 --clusters ~/clusters.conf --limit-cluster cluster1

# Team 2, who monitors cluster2 http://localhost:8002
sudo gdash -p 8002 --clusters ~/clusters.conf --limit-cluster cluster2
