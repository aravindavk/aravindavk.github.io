I adopted a similar technique while building https://crystal-lang.org[Crystal] programs. This is much simpler with Crystal because of the macros.

.hello.cr file
[source,crystal]
----
SOURCE_HASH = {{ `sha256sum #{__FILE__} | cut -d' ' -f1`.chomp.stringify }}

puts SOURCE_HASH
----

Build step:

[source,console]
----
$ crystal build hello.cr
----

Verify:

[source,console]
----
$ ./hello
cdb9db6f5ac4a0df1ed06de118c569fa225785685849d533c1ba550854b8b4ab
$ sha256sum hello.cr
cdb9db6f5ac4a0df1ed06de118c569fa225785685849d533c1ba550854b8b4ab  hello.cr
----

Similarly, if `shards` is used as the package manager for your Crystal Programs, then you can include the `VERSION` automatically while compiling the program.

[source,crystal]
----
VERSION = {{ `shards version #{__DIR__}`.chomp.stringify }}

puts VERSION
----
